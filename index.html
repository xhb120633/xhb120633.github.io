                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a Ph.D student in Psychology program at Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in computational cognitive sciences. Prior to coming to Georgia Tech, I earned a M.A degree from University of Arizona. I spend my entire master and Ph.D. career with my supervisor, Dr. Robert Wilson. Even before, I spent three years at Peking University as a full-time RA in CBCS. I earned my undergraduate degree of Human Resource Management in Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in China. Currently, I am visititing Tom Griffiths' CoCoSci Lab at Princeton University!</p>
		<p> My research interests broadly stand at the intersection of Cognitive Sciences and Artificial Intelligence. My thesis area is about to using Large Language Models to understand how humans think in decision-making and learning with think aloud protocol. I use a variety of computational tools and tasks to research on this fancy topic. But my research interests also wonder how AI models (e.g., LLMs, agents) behave and think, and how we could utilize human experiences and human data to faciliate AI models and research, such as human-AI interactions, AI interpretability and even AGI!<p>
                <p>Beyond my own research, I am also contributing to general research community. I co-founded <a href="https://rldmjc.github.io//">MindRL-Hub</a>, a community to faciliate the research and application of Reinforcement Learning in psychology and neuroscience. I also co-founded <a href="https://www.mind-ai.org/">Mind-AI</a>, a community to faciliate the research and application of AI in psychology and neuroscience. I am also a member of <a href="https://www.mind-ai.org/">Mind-AI</a>, a community to faciliate the research and application of AI in psychology and neuroscience.</p>

                <h2>Research Highlights</h2>
                <div class="research-highlight">
                    <h3>Understanding human decision-making and learning from Think Aloud with Large Langugae Models.</h3>
                    <p>Think Aloud protocol is to ask human participants to speak out their thoughts while doing psychological tasks. Previous research mainly use behavioral measurements (typically button presses) to understand human cognitive processes. These mental models are typically proposed and tested by researchers themselves, which can sometimes be biased and limited. If we could directly ask about participants' thoughts, we could have an inner probe to human minds in the task. However, past research about think aloud mainly rely on subjective coding, which has human experts to label or interpret the content of think aloud. This can be labor-intensive, subjective and limited. With the advent of LLMs, we saw the opportunity to revisit this old protocol with brand new approaches. We can use LLMs to do nearly 'anything' about think aloud. From quantifying them to interpreting the content and predicting the following behaviors, we have done some work on this to explore the feasibility of this new approach. </p>

                <div class="research-highlight">
                    <h3>Reverse engineering of human thoughts.</h3>
                    <p>Human thoughts are hard to define, capture and model, but they are always there. Understanding human thoughts in a variety of tasks, figuring out the princeples of human thoughts and generalizing and predicting the thoughts are essential to understand human intelligence and inspire AGI. One reason that this fundemental question is so hard for scientists is thoughts are implicit, and language is diverse and richful. This means, knowing what a person speaks does not neccesarily knows what he is thinking about. In this project, rather than a forward thinking about how human thoughts generate behaviors in the project above, we aim to understand givev observed behaviors and potentially other measurements, can we infer the human thoughts from the data and models?</p>
		<p>This project not only aims to establish a strong and generalized connection between behavior and thoughts to facilliate our understanding into human minds, it also aims to inspire understanding machine 'thoughts' through a human-centered way. If the computation of complex models (such as AlphaGo) could be approximate by a human-data trained model, we are able to understand how the model thinks in its computation with natural langugaes. And this will empower a deeper level of human-AI interaction, that AI can teach humans something they don't really know! This project is planned and initiated and will be my main work project at Princeton University!<p>

                    <h3>Improving Artificial Intelligence through humans.</h3>
                    <p>This project intends to understand how we can understand AI in the view of human psychology and neuroscience. Knowing its success and fallbacks, we could understand how and why AI is better or worse than human intelligence in some aspects. More importantly, we need those findings to improve AI performance, not only in solving hard problems, but also bringing society impact to humans. Finally, I believe there must be a lot of things that humans can learn from advanced AI models, in case we could figure out the right way to look into them!</p>

                    <h3>Accelerating Scientific Discoveries in Cognitive Sciences.</h3>
                    <p>Human minds are attractive and mysterious. Though we can feel our thoughts, feelings, emotions and actions many time in our daily life, it is very hard for cognitive scientissts and psychologists to formally describe, interpret and predict human minds and subsequent behaviors. Many ideas and theories about our cognition were actually inspired by human heuristics, validated by experiments and computational models. However, those validations may not be able to tell truth beyond the hypothetical space. Therefore, how we could transform the research paradigms in cognitive science and psychology matters in the era of Artificial Intelligence. For example, LLMs can have vast of knowledges and inductive biases, and perhaps more knowledgeable than any single human. Especially given most fashioned langugae-based reasoning model have high capacity of thinking, they may think better than human scientists as well. Can we build up such pipeline to discover phenomenon, construct computational models and develop scientific theories without human inductive bias? These would be fun to investigate along with those empirical topics above!</p>
